# Dataset_ExperimentalDataTC
The data comes from different experiments using the samples collected from Volc√°n de Colima. Each experiment recorded the temperature variations over time for a thermocouple that was inserted to a different depth in the sample which was heated to the highest temperature. The data shows the time and temperature values for each thermocouple.
